# Labyrinth-navigation-with-Branch-and-Bound

## Problem: Implement the algorithm Branch and Bound to navigate a labyrinth.
In our code, the labyrinth is consisted of a matrix of matrices where '0' symbolizes a wall (non walkable square) and a letter symbolizes a walkable square.
This is the labyrinth that the code was implemented for:

## Some more info:
- The code runs for Python 2.
- There are plenty of comments inside the .py file to help with the understanding of the code.
- This repository was created to help others in need but also to show the experience i gained as a student.
